# Calculate-My-GPA
Calculate My GPA is an android app created using XML and Java. Firebase is used as the database. Students are already registered in the database and their results have been updated. Registered students can see their current GPA according to the results they obtained and they can predict their future GPA by adding results to the upcoming subjects. Also, they can see the progress to achieve a class from second lower, second upper or first class.
